wordpress-easy-install
======================

You can simply run this code to automatically install and configure wordpress.
Tested with fedora GNOME and it runs only in it.

This code makes you lazy since it installs wordpress and its dependency packages and configure it.. Finally launches in firefox automatically. ;)
